# swarm-effective-coverage-
Realization and improvement of effective coverage, using description functions 
Code realizing the effective coverage method.
Use discriptor function, the target fields and the coverage capacity of each one of the robot in the swarm are modeled.
The control velocities are calculated according to the gradients of the difference between the target and the jobs been done.
